# Voice-To-Text — a local, free Wispr-Flow clone

Dictation that runs **entirely on your Mac** by default — no cloud, no
subscription, nothing leaving your machine. An optional **Online** mode runs it
on Groq's cloud (one free key) for any Mac with no downloads.

## Platforms — pick your OS

|  | |
|---|---|
| 🍎 **macOS** | The full app: **offline** (on-device Whisper + local LLM) *or* online. Installs from source — keep reading below. |
| 🪟 **Windows** | **Online (Groq) edition** — setup & docs in **[windows/README.md](windows/README.md)**. Download the prebuilt `.exe` from the **[Releases page](../../releases)**, or run from source. |

> Same project, same core logic — just two front-ends. **Everything below is for macOS.**

## 🪄 Easiest install — just ask Claude

**You don't need to know GitHub or the terminal.** If you have
[**Claude Code**](https://claude.com/claude-code) (the CLI) or **Claude Cowork**
(Anthropic's agent in the Claude desktop app) on your Mac, just give it this one line:

> **Clone and install https://github.com/Gregory-Esman/voice-to-text and set it up.**

> **On Windows?** Ask Claude to *"clone voice-to-text and set up the Windows version"* — it follows [`windows/README.md`](windows/README.md) (online/Groq edition, no model downloads). Or just download the `.exe` from [Releases](../../releases).

Claude does everything for you — installs the tools, downloads the models, builds
the app, and sets it to start at login. At the very end it'll show you **three
permission switches to flip** in System Settings (the only step a human has to do —
Apple won't let software toggle those). Then tap **Right Option** and start talking.

*Requires an Apple Silicon Mac (M1–M5). Prefer to do it yourself? See [Quick install](#quick-install-apple-silicon-mac) below.*

---

- 🎙️ **Speech-to-text** — OpenAI **Whisper large-v3**. **Offline:** on-device via
  Apple's **MLX** framework (~0.3 s). **Online:** the same model on **Groq**
  (~0.5 s, runs on any Mac). Same hotkey either way.
- ⚡ **Raw & fast by design** — dictation pastes the transcription directly (light
  cleanup only: de-duplication + a hallucination guard), so it's quick and faithful
  to exactly what you said. Want it polished? Use the **Write key** (below), on demand.
- 🌊 **Recording HUD** — a floating waveform pill appears while you talk, with a
  ✕ to cancel and a ✓ to confirm (just like Wispr Flow).
- ⌨️ **Toggle hotkey + auto-paste** — tap a global hotkey to start, tap again to
  stop; the cleaned text is pasted into whatever app you're in.
- 🔊 **Voice-tone aware** — measures each recording's loudness + pitch vs. your
  own adaptive baseline; if you sound excited it adds exclamation marks even when
  the words are neutral, and a mid-sentence pause becomes a paragraph break.
  Tunable via `[tone]` in `config.toml`.
- ✏️ **Command / Write key** (Left Option) — one key, two jobs depending on
  whether you've selected text:
  - **Text selected → edit it.** Speak an instruction ("make this friendlier",
    "turn into bullet points", "fix the grammar", "translate to Spanish") and the
    AI rewrites your selection in place.
  - **Nothing selected → write it for you.** Speak what you want ("draft an email
    to my manager saying I'll be late", "message Jake to reschedule dinner") and
    the AI drafts it and types it at your cursor — styled to the app
    (professional in Gmail, casual in Slack), with no `[placeholders]` to fill in.
  - Runs on **Groq `gpt-oss-120b`** (~0.5 s, sharp drafts) when a Groq key is set;
    falls back to a local model (**`gpt-oss:20b`**) otherwise — see
    [Pick your mode](#pick-your-mode-the-installer-asks--no-config-editing).
- 🕘 **Dictation history** — every dictation is saved (`history.jsonl`); open the
  history window (Settings ▸ Dictation History…) and double-click any past
  entry to copy it back to the clipboard.
- 🍎 Menu-bar-only app (🎤 idle · 🔴 recording · ⏳ processing), no Dock icon.

> **Note on "Wispr" vs "Whisper":** *Wispr Flow* (the commercial app) uses a
> proprietary, cloud-only model you cannot download. The open model everyone
> means by "the large model" is **Whisper** (OpenAI) — and that's exactly what
> this uses, locally.

---

## Pick your mode (the installer asks — no config editing)

Run `./setup.sh` and it asks which mode you want. **Offline is the default and
what we recommend.** You can switch anytime later from the menu-bar icon (▸ Offline
mode) or during the first-run setup wizard.

| | **🟢 Offline** (default) | **🔵 Online** |
|---|---|---|
| Dictation | Whisper **on-device** (~0.3 s) | Groq **`whisper-large-v3`** (~0.5 s) |
| Write/edit (left ⌥) | local **`gpt-oss:20b`** | Groq **`gpt-oss-120b`** (sharper) |
| Keys needed | **none** | **one** free Groq key |
| Hardware | 16 GB+ Apple Silicon | **any** Apple-Silicon Mac (no GPU) |
| Privacy | **100% on-device** — nothing leaves your Mac | only your dictation goes to Groq |
| Downloads | Whisper ~3 GB + gpt-oss:20b ~13 GB (once) | none |
| Best for | privacy, working offline | speed, low-spec / shared machines |

Both modes run the **same code** — the mode is just config. The installer collects
any key, writes a gitignored `config.local.toml`, and never commits it. The key is
stored in your **macOS Keychain** (encrypted), not in the project.

```bash
./setup.sh            # asks: Offline or Online (Offline is the default)
./setup.sh --online   # or --offline   (non-interactive)
```

**Online runs everything on Groq** — `whisper-large-v3` for dictation and
`gpt-oss-120b` (OpenAI's open model) for the left-⌥ AI write/edit — over an
OpenAI-compatible API, so **one free key** does both. Groq punctuates the whole
clip at once and you can stop talking naturally without clipping the last word.
Prefer OpenAI or another provider? It's OpenAI-compatible — one-line swap in
`config.local.toml`.

> **Experimental:** a streaming-dictation preset (`config.assemblyai.toml`, via
> AssemblyAI) is also included for the lowest stop-to-text latency — but it
> segments on pauses, so Groq is the recommended online mode.

## Quick install (Apple Silicon Mac)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gregory-Esman/voice-to-text.git
cd voice-to-text
./setup.sh          # asks: Offline or Online? (Offline is the default)
```

`setup.sh` installs `uv` + Ollama, pulls the model, builds the app, and (optionally)
adds it to `/Applications` + login. Requires an **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1–M5);
Offline mode needs ~16 GB free for the two on-device models.

On first launch a polished **setup wizard** walks you through the three macOS
permissions (with live green checkmarks as you grant each), lets you pick
**Offline or Online** (and pastes any keys into the macOS Keychain), choose your
two hotkeys, and download the on-device models with a live progress bar. You can
re-run it anytime from the menu (**Setup / Onboarding…**). (See the
[ask-Claude install](#-easiest-install--just-ask-claude-code) at the top for the
no-terminal path.)

## Two ways to run it

### A) As a real Mac app (recommended)

```bash
./build_app.sh
```

This produces **`Voice To Text.app`** in this folder. Double-click it, or drag
it to `/Applications`. It auto-starts Ollama if needed.

**Clicking the app opens the Settings window** (microphone picker + warm-mic
toggle). The first click also starts the background dictation agent; later
clicks just re-open Settings — there's only ever one agent running. The agent
itself is a menu-bar-only background process (no Dock icon).

The app is a thin launcher that runs the code in this folder, so editing
`flow.py` / `config.toml` takes effect on the next launch — no rebuild needed.

### Start automatically at login

The app is registered as a hidden **Login Item**, so macOS launches it at login
the same way clicking it does — which gives the agent the GUI context its
windows need (a launchd-run agent can't show windows). On a cold start it just
starts the background agent silently; it does not pop Settings.

```bash
# turn OFF auto-start at login:
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to delete (every login item whose name is "Voice To Text")'

# turn it back ON:
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to make login item at end with properties {path:"/Applications/Voice To Text.app", hidden:true}'
```

You can also manage it in **System Settings ▸ General ▸ Login Items**.

### B) From the terminal (for development)

```bash
uv run python flow.py
```

…or double-click `start.command`.

---

## One-time permissions

Dictation needs three macOS permissions. The app inherits them from its own
Python interpreter (`.venv/bin/python`), so when prompted, **allow the process
named "Python"** (or add `Voice To Text.app` manually).

Open **System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security** and make sure the app/Python is
enabled under:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| **Microphone** | to record your voice (you'll get a prompt on first run) |
| **Accessibility** | to detect the global hotkey & to paste (Cmd+V) into apps |
| **Input Monitoring** | so the hotkey works while other apps are focused |

> If you ever ran the old terminal launcher and granted permission to **`uv`**,
> you can safely remove `uv` from Accessibility / Input Monitoring — the app now
> uses its own Python directly.

On the **first dictation**, Whisper large-v3-turbo (~1.5 GB) downloads from
Hugging Face and is cached. Every run after that is instant.

---

## Using it

1. A 🎤 appears in your menu bar.
2. Click into any text field (Notes, Slack, browser, code editor…).
3. Press the hotkey — default **⌃⌥D** (Ctrl+Alt+D). The floating **waveform
   pill** appears (and a *Tink* sound plays). The bars react to your voice.
4. Speak. To finish, **press the hotkey again** or click the **✓** on the pill.
   To throw the recording away, click the **✕** (nothing gets pasted).
5. The text is transcribed, smart-formatted, and **pasted where your cursor
   is**. Icon returns to 🎤.

### Smart formatting examples

| You say | You get |
|---|---|
| "um so i bought apples and then milk no wait i mean oat milk and bread" | "I bought apples, oat milk, and bread." |
| "first sunscreen second the passports and third the chargers" | A numbered list |
| "send it to john period new paragraph thanks" | "Send it to John.\n\nThanks" |

## Configuration

Edit **`config.toml`** and relaunch.

- **`[hotkey] combo`** — the trigger. Examples: `"<cmd>+<shift>+<space>"`,
  `"<f9>"`, `"<ctrl>+<alt>+d"`.
- **`[transcription] backend`** — `"local"` (Whisper/MLX), `"assemblyai"` (streaming),
  or `"cloud"` (OpenAI-compatible batch). `model` is any `mlx-community/whisper-*`.
- **`[transcription] language`** — `"en"` (faster) or `""` to auto-detect.
- **`[formatting]`** — the **Write key** model: `ollama_url` + `model` (`gpt-oss:20b`
  on-device) or `command_base_url` + `command_model` (e.g. Groq `gpt-oss-120b`).
- **`[paste]`** — `auto_paste` and `restore_clipboard`.
- **`[sounds]`** — start/stop/cancel audio cues.

## How it works

```
DICTATE (Right ⌥):
hotkey ─▶ AudioRecorder (sounddevice, 16 kHz mono) ──▶ live level ─▶ waveform HUD
        └▶ Offline: Whisper large-v3 (mlx_whisper)        ── on-device, GPU/ANE
           Online:  Groq whisper-large-v3 (cloud API)     ── any Mac, ~0.5 s
              └▶ light cleanup ─▶ pbcopy + Cmd+V into the focused app

WRITE / EDIT (Left ⌥):
spoken instruction ─▶ gpt-oss:20b (local) or Groq gpt-oss-120b ─▶ typed at cursor
```

The HUD is a non-activating Cocoa `NSPanel`, so clicking ✕/✓ never steals focus
from the app you're pasting into. All in `flow.py` — it's meant to be tweaked.

## Troubleshooting

- **Hotkey does nothing** → grant **Accessibility** + **Input Monitoring** to
  the app's Python, then quit and relaunch the app.
- **"Could not start recording"** → grant **Microphone** access; check the input
  device in System Settings ▸ Sound.
- **Formatting skipped** → make sure Ollama is running (the app starts it for
  you; `ollama serve` to start manually).
- **Pastes into the wrong place** → it pastes wherever the cursor was when you
  stopped; click your target field first.
- **Logs** → see `voice-to-text.log` in this folder.
